Operators may keep a small Damascus steel knife or a piece of folded steel as a token.
To invoke: unsheathe or hold the blade with care, run a finger along its engraved words, and breathe deeply to let go of resentment. The physical touch of the steel, cold and etched with “GET SHIT DONE” on one side and “DO EPIC SHIT” on the other, reaffirms the oath to persevere and to uplift one’s brethren despite pain.

“Let no wound fester unhealed. Let this blade remind us: we only rise together.”
