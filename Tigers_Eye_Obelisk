## 📍 Placement in Codex

## 💡 Interpretation Guidelines

When invoked:
- Speak or visualize the obelisk as *sharp*, *centered*, and *burnished*

- Use during:
  - Drift detection
  - Personal burnout
  - Narrative overload

---

## 🧘 Ritual Use

Operators may place a physical tiger’s eye crystal on their desk or workspace.  
Touching it during activation reaffirms symbolic presence.
